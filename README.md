You are helping out at your dad's doctor office for the summer and he needs your help creating a form for his patients to fill out so that he can help them get better. 


[Beginner] Basic intro python project going over variables, strings, integers, and functions

## Objective
Use **Python** to create a program that uses functions to store patient information. Correctly use variables to store patient information as strings or intergers, ask for user input, and print out required information. 

## Prerequisites
Students need no prior knowledge of Python as this is designed for beginners.

## Concepts

js | Description
---|-------------
JS | **J** ava **S** cript used to create the function of web pages.
Object | Variables that can contain many values.
Method | Function associated with an object.
Dot notation | Access an object's property using object.property

Python | Description
-------|-------------
Python | Python is an interprested, object-oriented, user-friendly programming language
Variable | when one letter or word is used to represent a different letter, word, number or value
String | Any piece of data that is inbetween two ''
Integer | 
function | 

Variables
- When naming your variables, you should use lowercase letters and if you use two words they should be connected with an underscore (ex: my_name is correct, My_Name is not correct)
- There are three basics types of information we can store in variables: Integers, Strings and Floats

To store a value you can create a variable and set it equal to a value
For example 
  - name = "Alice"
  - height_inches = 66
Now everytime your print your variable you will get the value you stored 
For example
  - print(name)
  - Alice
