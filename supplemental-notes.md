# Python

### Variables
A variable is when one letter or word is used to represent a different letter, word, number, or value
- A python variable can be programmed to remember all kinds of information!
- If I want the computer to remember that my name is Alyssa so I dont have to keep typing it in I can store it as a variable.
  - ex: my_name = "Alyssa"
  
Variable Syntax
- Variables should use lowercase letters
- If your variable is more than one word, there should be an underscore between the two (like height_inches)
 
What can a variable remeber?
  - Strings - any piece of data that you put between two single quotes '  '
    - ex: my_string = 'This string is all about python'
